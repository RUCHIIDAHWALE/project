        A final year project is typically a comprehensive project completed by students as a part of their academic curriculum,
        usually in the final year of their study program. It is an opportunity for students to demonstrate their mastery of
        coursework by applying their knowledge and skills to a real-world project.
              <br />
            Whether a final year project counts as experience for a fresher depends on the context and the hiring company's
         policies. Some companies may view a final year project as valuable experience, particularly if it is relevant to the job
         for which the fresher is applying. In other cases, a final year project may not be considered as equivalent to
         professional work experience.
